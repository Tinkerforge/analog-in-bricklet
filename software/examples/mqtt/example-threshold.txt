# Change XYZ to the UID of your Analog In Bricklet

setup:
	# Get threshold callbacks with a debounce time of 10 seconds (10000ms)
	publish '{"debounce": 10000}' to tinkerforge/request/analog-in_bricklet/XYZ/set_debounce_period
	# Handle incoming voltage reached callbacks
	subscribe to tinkerforge/callback/analog_in_bricklet/XYZ/voltage_reached
	publish '{"register": true}' to tinkerforge/register/analog_in_bricklet/XYZ/voltage_reached # Register voltage_reached callback
	# Configure threshold for voltage "smaller than 5 V"
	publish '{"option": "smaller", "min_voltage": 5000, "max_voltage": 0}' to tinkerforge/request/analog_in_bricklet/XYZ/set_voltage_callback_threshold
